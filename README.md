# üîç LinkedIn Profile Analyzer

**A lightweight, offline Python CLI tool that helps you audit your LinkedIn profile PDF for completeness, clarity, and impact.**


---

## Features

- Detects **missing sections** (About, Experience, Skills, etc.)  
- Flags **overused buzzwords** (like "team player", "go-getter", "results-driven")  
- Shows **top word usage stats** so you know what you're really emphasizing  
- Helps you optimize your profile for clarity and keyword relevance

---

## Why?

Your LinkedIn profile is your digital first impression. But:
- Most people never read their own PDF export
- Buzzwords dilute your actual impact
- Recruiters skim for keywords, and this shows what stands out

This tool helps you **see your profile the way a recruiter or ATS might**.
